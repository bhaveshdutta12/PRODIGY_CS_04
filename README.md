# Simple Keylogger

This is a basic Python-based keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes. The keys pressed on the keyboard are saved to a text file for logging purposes.

## Features

- **Keylogging**: Captures all keystrokes, including regular characters and special keys (e.g., Enter, Shift).
- **Logging to File**: Saves the recorded keystrokes to a file (`keylogs.txt`).
- **Listener**: Stops logging when the 'Esc' key is pressed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library

To install the required library:

```bash
pip install pynput
```

# How to Use

2. Install the dependencies as mentioned above.

3. Run the keylogger script:
